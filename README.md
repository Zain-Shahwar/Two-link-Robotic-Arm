# Two-link-Robotic-Arm
Design and Development of Two link Robotic Arm in Matlab using Robotic Toolbox for Matlab

# INTRODUCTION:
This a hobby project which I have done in Matlab. The motivation behind this project is to learn more about robotics using Matlab.
The objective to learn and implement the basics of mathematics and physics behind the development of manipulator in an environment where I can easily simulation and visualize the position and orientaion of robotic arm. I started from the very basics and cover the following points given below:

1. From the transformation and orientation of plane from one point to the other, 
2. Perform Inverse and Forward Kinematics of serial robot and visualize the end effector pose in 3D graph.
3. Perform Inverse and Forward dynamics using Euler-Lagrangian or Newton Euler algorithm. 
4. Implementation of PID control in joint and Cartesian space to control each joint position.
5. Trajactory planning to find the optimal solution to go from reference point to the goal point.

After completing all the above points, I have also show how to use G-code and M-code as an input and plot the given reference 2D shapes or images.

# LIBARARY:
I started to develop this 2-link planner robot using library "Robotics Toolbox for Matlab" from Peter Corke.
