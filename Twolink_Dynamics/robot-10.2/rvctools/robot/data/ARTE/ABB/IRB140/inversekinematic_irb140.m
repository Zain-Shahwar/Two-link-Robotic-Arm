%   Q = INVERSEKINEMATIC_IRB140(robot, T)	
%   Solves the inverse kinematic problem for the ABB IRB 140 robot
%   where:
%   robot stores the robot parameters.
%   T is an homogeneous transform that specifies the position/orientation
%   of the end effector.
%
%   A call to Q=INVERSEKINEMATIC_IRB140 returns 8 possible solutions, thus,
%   Q is a 6x8 matrix where each column stores 6 feasible joint values.
%
%   
%   Example code:
%
%   >>abb=load_robot('ABB', 'IRB140');
%   >>q = [0 0 0 0 0 0];	
%   >>T = directkinematic(abb, q);
%
%   %Call the inversekinematic for this robot
%
%   >> qinv = inversekinematic(abb, T);
%
%   check that all of them are feasible solutions!
%   and every Ti equals T
%
%   for i=1:8,
%        Ti = directkinematic(abb, qinv(:,i))
%   end

%Arrange solutions, there are 8 possible solutions so far.

%Note that in this robot, the joint q3 has a non-simmetrical range. In this
%case, the joint ranges from 60 deg to -219 deg, thus, the typical normalizing
%step is avoided in this angle (the next line is commented). When solving
%for the orientation, the solutions are normalized to the [-pi, pi] range
%only for the theta4, theta5 and theta6 joints.
